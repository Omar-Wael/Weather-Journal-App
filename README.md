# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Project Environment setup

### Node and Express Environment

In this project we are using Node and Express environments. Node and Express should be installed on the local machine. The project file server.js should require express(), and should create an instance of their app using express.

The Express app instance should be pointed to the project folder with .html, .css, and .js files.

### Project Dependencies

The ‘cors’ package should be installed in the project from the command line, required in the project file server.js, and the instance of the app should be setup to use cors().

The body-parser package should be installed and included in the project.

### Local Server

Local server should be running and producing feedback to the Command Line through a working callback function.

### API Credentials

Create API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com or use existing API key inside :)

## Run

### Install Dependencies

1- open a terminal at the root directory and run the command

2- npm install express

3- npm install cors

4- npm install body-parser

## Start server

1- On the same terminal, Run `node server.js` for a dev server.

2- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Hint:

- Before Installing any Dependencies, You have to make a new folder (make it the root directory), and take the server.js file and put it in that folder.
- Then take the Weather-Journal-App folder and put it in the root folder.
